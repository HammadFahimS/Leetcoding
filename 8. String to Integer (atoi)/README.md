### String to Integer (atoi) Solution

#### Problem Statement
The "String to Integer (atoi)" problem is a common coding challenge that mimics the conversion functionality of the `atoi` function in C/C++. The task is to convert a string input into a 32-bit signed integer. The function must handle spaces, optional signs (+ or -), numerical characters, and disregard any subsequent non-numerical characters.

#### Solution Overview
This solution carefully processes the input string to handle spaces, signs, and numbers accurately while ignoring irrelevant characters. It ensures compliance with the 32-bit signed integer range and returns the appropriate value if overflow or underflow conditions are met.

#### Detailed Explanation
- **Whitespace Handling:** The function strips any leading or trailing spaces to focus on the relevant part of the string for conversion.
- **Sign Detection:** It checks for the presence of '+' or '-' at the beginning of the string to determine the sign of the resulting integer.
- **Numeric Conversion:** The function then iterates over each character, converting it to an integer and building the final number by multiplying the current result by 10 and adding the new digit, stopping if a non-digit is encountered.
- **Boundary Check:** After constructing the number, it checks whether the result fits within the 32-bit signed integer range. If not, it adjusts the result to the nearest limit.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string. The function processes each character once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \). The function uses a constant amount of space for storing intermediate values such as the result and the sign.

#### Results
- **Runtime:** 14 ms, which places it in the top 85.49% of all submissions. This excellent performance suggests that the function handles a variety of inputs efficiently.
- **Memory Usage:** 11.64 MB, which is better than 58.16% of submissions. This indicates that the memory footprint of the solution is within a reasonable range for the problem.

#### Usage
To utilize this solution, simply include it within a Python script and call the `myAtoi` function with a string argument:
```python
sol = Solution()
result = sol.myAtoi("   -42")
print(result)  # Output will be -42
```

#### Contributions
Contributions to improve the solution are welcome, especially those that could further optimize the approach or reduce the memory footprint.
