# 3Sum Closest Solution

#### Problem Statement
The "3Sum Closest" problem (LeetCode #16) challenges us to find three integers in an array such that the sum is closest to a given target number. The objective is not just to find any triplet, but the one whose sum is nearest to the specified target, minimizing the absolute difference.

#### Solution Overview
The solution involves sorting the input array and using a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the closest sum. The approach leverages sorted array properties to streamline the search process, reducing unnecessary computations.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted initially to enable the two-pointer technique to work effectively.
2. **Closest Sum Initialization**: Start by initializing the closest sum with the sum of the first three elements. This serves as a baseline for comparison.
3. **Two-Pointer Approach**: For each element in the array, the two other elements are explored using a two-pointer approach. The sum of these three elements is continuously compared against the target to determine if it is closer than previously identified sums.

#### Step-by-Step Process
Consider the example array `nums = [1, 2, -1, -4]` and `target = 1`. Here's how the solution operates after sorting the array to `[-4, -1, 1, 2]`:

| Step | Fixed Element | Left Pointer | Right Pointer | Current Sum | Closest Sum | Absolute Difference | Action |
|------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1    | -4            | -1           | 2             | -3          | -3          | 4                   | Update closest sum and difference |
| 2    | -4            | 1            | 2             | -1          | -1          | 2                   | Update closest sum and difference |
| 3    | -1            | 1            | 2             | 2           | 2           | 1                   | Update closest sum and difference |


#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This includes the \(O(n \log n)\) complexity for sorting and \(O(n^2)\) for the two-pointer search.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the space used does not scale with the input size, excluding the input and output storage.

#### Performance Metrics
- **Runtime**: 459 ms, an efficient performance that beats 73.44% of other submissions.
- **Memory Usage**: 11.58 MB, which is lower than 87.94% of other submissions.

#### Conclusion
The "3Sum Closest" solution presented is effective in finding the triplet closest to the target sum. It combines sorting with a two-pointer technique to minimize the time complexity and efficiently explore potential triplet combinations.
