# Letter Combinations of a Phone Number Solution

#### Problem Statement
The "Letter Combinations of a Phone Number" problem (LeetCode #17) challenges us to generate all possible letter combinations that the number could represent, similar to the letter mappings on a traditional mobile phone keypad.

#### Solution Overview
The solution leverages a backtracking approach to generate all possible letter combinations for the input digit string. Each digit corresponds to certain letters (like on a mobile phone keypad), and the algorithm explores all combinations of these letters.

#### Detailed Explanation
The algorithm uses a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters, and then it performs a series of recursive calls to build combinations:

1. **Mapping Setup**: A dictionary `mapping` is used where each digit (from '2' to '9') is associated with its corresponding letters.
2. **Initial Setup**: An empty list `multiplied` is initialized to store intermediate combinations.
3. **Combination Construction**:
   - For each digit in the input, the algorithm extends each existing combination by appending each possible letter associated with the current digit.

#### Step-by-Step Process
Given the digits "23", the following steps illustrate how combinations are generated:

| Step | Current Digit | Possible Letters | Previous Combinations | New Combinations |
|------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| 1    | 2             | a, b, c          | ['']                  | ['a', 'b', 'c']  |
| 2    | 3             | d, e, f          | ['a', 'b', 'c']       | ['ad', 'ae', 'af', 'bd', 'be', 'bf', 'cd', 'ce', 'cf'] |

#### Code Implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        mapping = {
            '2': ['a', 'b', 'c'], '3': ['d', 'e', 'f'], '4': ['g', 'h', 'i'],
            '5': ['j', 'k', 'l'], '6': ['m', 'n', 'o'], '7': ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
            '8': ['t', 'u', 'v'], '9': ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        }
        if len(digits) < 2:
            return mapping[digits] if digits else []
        multiplied = ['']
        for char in digits:
            multiplied = [x + y for x in multiplied for y in mapping[char]]
        return multiplied
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(3^N \times 4^M)\), where \(N\) is the number of digits in the input that map to 3 letters, and \(M\) is the number of digits that map to 4 letters. This reflects the worst-case scenario of generating all possible combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(3^N \times 4^M)\) for storing the output combinations.

#### Performance Metrics
- **Runtime**: 4 ms, which is faster than 98.88% of other submissions.
- **Memory Usage**: 11.64 MB, better than 65.56% of other submissions.

#### Conclusion
This solution provides an efficient and comprehensive method to generate all possible letter combinations from a string of digits, mimicking the behavior of the number-to-letter mappings on traditional mobile phone keypads. The provided code is both efficient in runtime and effective in handling various input sizes.
