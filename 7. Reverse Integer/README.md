# Reverse Integer

#### Problem Statement
The "Reverse Integer" problem requires reversing the digits of a 32-bit signed integer. The function should return the reversed integer unless the reversed integer overflows. If the reversed integer goes beyond the 32-bit signed integer range \([-2^{31}, 2^{31} - 1]\), it should return 0.

#### Solution Overview
This solution handles the reversal of a given integer using arithmetic operations, checking for overflow conditions explicitly. The integer is reversed digit by digit, and at each step, the solution checks if appending another digit would cause an overflow.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Negative Number Handling:** The algorithm first checks if the input integer is negative. If it is, the integer is converted to positive to simplify the reversal process.
2. **Reversal Process:** The solution reverses the integer by continually extracting the last digit (using modulus operation), appending it to the result (after multiplying the current result by 10), and then reducing the input number by one decimal place (using integer division).
3. **Overflow Check:** After constructing the reversed number, the solution checks if it lies within the 32-bit signed integer range. If not, it returns 0.

#### Code Snippet
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        signed = False
        if x < 0:
            signed = True
            x = -x
        
        reversed = 0
        while x != 0:
            digit = x % 10
            reversed = reversed * 10 + digit
            x //= 10
            
        if signed:
            reversed = -reversed
        
        if reversed < -2**31 or reversed > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0
        return reversed
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in \( O(\log n) \) time, where \( n \) is the number of digits in the integer. This is because each iteration of the while loop processes one digit.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since a fixed number of variables are used regardless of the input size.

#### Results
- **Runtime:** 4 ms, which beats 99.49% of Python submissions. This outstanding performance highlights the efficiency of the arithmetic-based approach over more complex methods.
- **Memory Usage:** 11.70 MB, which is better than 24% of Python submissions. While this is relatively efficient, the space used is primarily due to the function call stack and the inherent overhead of managing integer operations in Python.

#### Contributions
Contributions to improve the solution are welcome, especially those that could further optimize the approach or reduce the memory footprint.
