# Zigzag Conversion

#### Problem Statement
The "Zigzag Conversion" problem on LeetCode asks for the reordering of characters from a given string into a "zigzag" pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading the characters row by row. The purpose is to simulate the reading process as it would appear if the characters were written in a zigzag pattern on an imaginary grid.

#### Solution Overview
This Python solution manages the conversion process by simulating the movement across the rows of a grid in a zigzag manner. Characters are added to specific rows based on the current direction of movement (downwards or upwards). The challenge is effectively handling the direction changes when the top or bottom of the grid is reached.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Dictionary Initialization:** A dictionary `chars_per_line` is created with keys representing each row where characters will be stored as they are encountered.
2. **Direction Control:** Two boolean flags, `goingDown` and `goingUp`, are used to track the direction of traversal across the rows. The direction changes at the top or bottom of the zigzag pattern.
3. **Character Placement:** The string is traversed character by character. Depending on the current direction, characters are added to the appropriate row in the dictionary. When a boundary (either top or bottom) is reached, the direction is reversed.
4. **Result Construction:** After the traversal, characters from each row are concatenated in order to form the final transformed string.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input string, because it processes each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \( O(n) \) as well, due to the storage requirements for the reordered characters in the dictionary.

#### Results
- **Runtime:** 87 ms, which beats 12.00% of Python submissions. This runtime suggests that while the solution is correct, there may be more efficient ways to handle the conversion, possibly by optimizing the condition checks or data structures used.
- **Memory Usage:** 12.12 MB, which is better than 6.14% of Python submissions. This metric indicates a relatively high memory usage, possibly due to the overhead of the dictionary structure and the storage of individual characters in separate list structures.

#### Example Code Snippet
```python
# Part of the solution showing the traversal and direction handling
for char in s:
    chars_per_line[currLine].append(char)
    if currLine == numRows or currLine == 1:
        goingDown = not goingDown
        goingUp = not goingUp
    currLine += 1 if goingDown else -1
```

#### How to Run
```bash
# Assuming the code is saved as solution.py and Python 3.x is installed
python solution.py
```
#### Contributions
Contributions to improve the solution are welcome, especially those that could further optimize the approach or reduce the memory footprint.
